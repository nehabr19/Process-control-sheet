# Development of an IoT-Based Furnace Temperature Monitoring System with Secure Data Access.

The iron is heated in the furnace, and a thermometer is used to record the temperature. The data is collected by an IoT device at regular intervals and transferred to the main server through a secure database. The data stored in the database is monitored to ensure that the temperature does not exceed 1100°C for safety precautions and does not drop below 1000°C to maintain precise quality.

To achieve this, we built a project that provides direct access to the data stored in the database. We created a signup page for officials authorized to access the temperature data. Through this signup page, they can register and log in. After logging in, a graph of the temperature data is displayed. By clicking on a point in the graph, the exact temperature at that particular time is shown. Scrolling down reveals a list of all temperature data for the day.
